Bubble Sort Visualization
A visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, created using JavaScript and the p5.js library.

Usage
To view and interact with the project:

Open the index.html file in your browser using Live Server.

If you are using VS Code, right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".
This is required to avoid browser restrictions on local file access.
Alternatively, you can:

Test the project with full visualization:

Important Note
Directly opening index.html in your browser without a server will result in the application not functioning as expected.
